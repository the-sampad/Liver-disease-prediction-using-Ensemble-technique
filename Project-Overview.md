# Project Overview
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has a 
liver disease or not based on various features such as age, gender, total bilirubin, direct 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, etc. I used an Ensemble technique that combines 
multiple models to improve the accuracy of our predictions.

I used the Indian Liver Patient Dataset obtained from the UCI Machine 
Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about 416 liver patients and 167 
non-liver patients. We will preprocess the data, visualize the data, train multiple models, 
and evaluate the models using various metrics. Finally, we will combine the models 
using the Ensemble technique and make our final prediction.
