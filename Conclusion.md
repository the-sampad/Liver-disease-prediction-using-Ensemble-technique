# Conclusion
In this project, we built a machine learning model to predict liver disease using an 
Ensemble technique. We loaded the data, performed exploratory data analysis, 
preprocessed the data, built three models, evaluated the models, and combined the 
models using the Ensemble technique. We achieved an accuracy of 73% using the 
Ensemble model.
